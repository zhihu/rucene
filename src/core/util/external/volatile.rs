//! Provides wrapper types `Volatile`, `ReadOnly`, `WriteOnly`, `ReadWrite`, which wrap any
//! copy-able type and allows for volatile memory access to wrapped value. Volatile memory accesses
//! are never optimized away by the compiler, and are useful in many low-level systems programming
//! and concurrent contexts.
//!
//! The wrapper types *do not* enforce any atomicity guarantees; to also get atomicity, consider
//! looking at the `Atomic` wrapper type found in `libcore` or `libstd`.
//!
//! These wrappers do not depend on the standard library and never panic.
//!
//! # Dealing with Volatile Pointers
//!
//! Frequently, one may have to deal with volatile pointers, eg, writes to specific memory
//! locations. The canonical way to solve this is to cast the pointer to a volatile wrapper
//! directly, eg:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use rucene::core::util::external::Volatile;
//!
//! let mut_ptr = 0xFEE00000 as *mut u32;
//!
//! let volatile_ptr = mut_ptr as *mut Volatile<u32>;
//! ```
//!
//! and then perform operations on the pointer as usual in a volatile way. This method works as all
//! of the volatile wrapper types are the same size as their contained values.
